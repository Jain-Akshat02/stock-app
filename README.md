# My Next.js Project

This project is built with Next.js ([https://nextjs.org](https://nextjs.org)) using the `create-next-app` ([https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app)) tool.  It leverages the power of Next.js App Router for a streamlined development experience.

## Features

* **Next.js App Router:** Built using the latest Next.js App Router architecture for improved performance and developer experience.
* **Optimized Font Loading:**  Utilizes `next/font` ([https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts)) for efficient loading of the Geist font family ([https://vercel.com/font](https://vercel.com/font)).  This ensures fast initial page load times...
